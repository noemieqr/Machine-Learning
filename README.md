# Machine-Learning
This repository contains assignments from the course: Machine Learning
# Description
Machine learning is the scientific field that provides computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed (definition by Wikipedia). Machine learning lies at the heart of many real-world applications, including recommender systems, web search, computer vision, autonomous cars and automatic language translation.

The course will provide an overview of fundamental topics as well as important trends in machine learning, including algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning, dimensionality reduction methods and their applications. A substantial lab section will involve group projects on a data science competition and will provide the students the ability to apply the course theory to real-world problems.
